# ✈️ Airline Management System (AMS)

## 📌 Project Title
**Airline Management System (AMS) - Java Swing Application**

---

## 📖 Project Description

The Airline Management System (AMS) is a Java-based desktop application developed using Java Swing and MySQL. It allows users to register their details such as username, password, date of birth, and phone number. The project provides a user-friendly interface where all data is securely stored in a MySQL database via JDBC.

This system simulates a simplified version of airline passenger registration. It forms the base module of a more comprehensive airline management system, which could be extended with additional features such as ticket booking, flight scheduling, admin login, and more. The primary aim of this project is to help students and beginner developers understand the integration of Java applications with relational databases using JDBC.
